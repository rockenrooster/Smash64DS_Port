# P2 Execution Board

Created: 2026-08-17.
Updated: 2026-09-16 continuation protocol; recorded runtime evidence unchanged.

**Last integrated Boundary GREEN: N04.08; P2-2p8 acceptance RED.** Figures below.

**The only dynamic queue.** Restart reads `docs/HANDOFF.md` + this file. Plans:
`docs/P2_PLAN.md` + `docs/p2/`. Closed rows: `docs/archive/P2_CLOSED_ROWS.md`.
Measurements: `PERF_LEDGER.md`. Chronology: `PORTING.md`. Those are lookup-only.

## Standing rules

1. **Measurement law:** `docs/VERIFYING.md` owns procedure and each entry's
   coverage. Boundary = `p2_shell_loop`, `p2_battle_realtime`,
   `p2_fourcpu_stress`. Gate arms use the one-minute match; soak is a separate flag.
2. Cadence verdicts use all presented frames; the 1,600-frame gameplay rank-80
   remains candidate-sizing evidence. Measure the configuration that actually
   ships (`nds_build_config.h` is truth).
3. **Publish law:** P2 publishes only verifier-covered `smash64ds.nds` from the
   shipping VS shell with human input — no scripted walk, no fast logic. Rebuild
   after each verified fix batch; the frozen P1 artifact is not rebuilt routinely.
4. Published P2 ROM after N04.08 + the clean rebuild, 2026-09-16. **Runtime proof
   owed** — the payload changed since the last runtime verification:

SHA-256 C6574420A9FC0E77B670093CE7AE1B595A62583488C5A9D72DD367877B0E9477

5. Performance/visibility evidence is permanent under `artifacts/performance`
   and `artifacts/visibility`. Device A/B reports include 2/3/4/5+ VBlank
   histogram, max interval, and P50/P95.

## Phase status

| Phase | State | Gate summary |
|---|---|---|
| P2-1 VS shell | **Loop and realtime arms GREEN** | Raw `0x152` pin, owner-image lifetime and CSS particle re-init fixed; laps flat; realtime fenced. Seven previews invisible; cadence/visual acceptance open. |
| P2-2 Four-fighter engine | **Capacity GREEN; performance RED (P2-2p8)** | Four-kind FPCs use 125,108 B plus a 336 B foreign bank; BPS1 directory resident. Low-water 111,680 B; libc reserve 40,960 B, weapon pool 10; scoped guards pass; FPS RED. |
| P2-3 Fighter production | **Acceptance OPEN** | Link Neutral-B/Spin have diagnostic output only. Samus morph proof needs human input. Preserve prior scoped proofs unless contradicted. |
| P2-4 Stage production | **Visual acceptance OPEN** | Collision parity passes. Audit-15 admission proved in `d8660bc2fd9`; natural Hyrule/Inishie pass. Three VS captures remain. |
| P2-5 Items | **Native coverage incomplete** | Sword lifetime repair recorded; fidelity-02 landed (`a8b6bd0`). Atlas membership, other kinds/children and interactions remain open. |
| P2-6 1P Game | **TALLY REACHED 09-14** | Guest playback wins stage 0 and reaches source StageClear (31,940, three bonuses; `a1209354b`). Open: next-stage Intro OOM (144,640 B asked, 120,164 B free), 41,952 native failures by the tally, DL overflow 3,744 B; shipping flag stays 0. |
| P2-7 Modes & meta | **Options/Backup Clear accepted 09-06; DATA blue screen diagnosed** | DATA/VS Record/Sound Test draw only through the retired MAIN text slab (audit 16): bake their surfaces (fix queued). Characters blits a real surface. 1P stays gated. |

## Current integration checkpoint

**Last qualified checkpoint:** N04.08 + clean rebuild + the 2026-09-16 cleanup,
Boundary GREEN all three arms. WORK-H **1,584,128 / 2,310,848**, FTR **356,608 /
740,352**; native **0/0**; realtime **26.4 FPS**; slips 0.
### Execution cursor

Focus / batch / IDs / owner: P2-2p8 / lane selection / N05.04 / main. Phase: SELECT.
**Next action:** every leaf lane is now spent with measurement and the gap is
unchanged at **-496,382**. Do NOT open another leaf. Either size an FTR/STG/MISC
candidate from `docs/optimization/` the way SRC's was (its premises did not
survive), or put the gate itself to the owner.
**Owner: four-CPU work runs `p2_fourcpu_stress` alone** (`VERIFYING.md`).
Completed: N04.03/N04.05/N04.08 KEEP; N04.04/N04.06/N04.07 REJECT (ledger).
Baseline moved 2026-09-16 (clean rebuild -50,432); dead code deleted.
**Gap:** `1,120,000` = two VBlank intervals; WORK-H P50 1.41x, **92.3% of frames
miss**; needs **-455,296**.
**Owner: 30 FPS at four players REQUIRED, NO 30 Hz sim** (-294,016 withdrawn,
`…_sim30-ceiling/`). Sacrifice Order: audio (1), visual (2), gameplay (3) more
expendable than the 60 Hz sim (4). Owner 2026-09-16: lab test builds allowed.
N05.01 (matrix stack) and N05.02 (collision family) are SPENT with measurement.
Engaging the 0%-engaged GX compose bank COSTS +22,848 P50; the sampled softfloat
census **over-attributes 3.0x** — never size from it again.
**N05.03 is CLOSED NO-GO** (`…_p2-2p8-n0503-flat-cache/`). Its recorded blocker
(23 decomp latch sites) was never needed: the flat cache is keyed per **joint**,
not per fighter root, so its 4 slots miss **49.7%**, and **95.4% of misses are
hash conflicts**. 16 slots fix it (miss 3.6%, **SRC -15,040**, the predicted
band) — but the **ARM9 dcache is 4 KB** and 16 slots is 3,264 B = 80% of it, so
**STG rises +51,520** and WORK-H **+33,984**. At constant memory (8x48) nothing
changes: the working set is 9-16 roots. Fetch, not arithmetic — the third lane
lost this way after the collision ring and the GX bank.
**`.itcm` IS FULL: 104 B free of 32,632.** The census overflowed it twice and was
removed. Any candidate adding resident code to these paths cannot be placed.
**THE ARITHMETIC IS CLOSED** for leaf levers: gate needs **-496,382 = 30.7% of
everything executed**; the profile's top twenty is 502,955. **The per-fighter
lever is MEASURED and spent** and **SRC's top candidate is SIZED NO-GO** — detail
for both in `docs/archive/P2_CLOSED_ROWS.md`; evidence in
`…_p2-2p8-joint-cap-ladder/` and `…_p2-2p8-src-candidate-sizing/`.
Checks: **Boundary GREEN all three arms** (free floor 114,628 B, realtime
**26.4 FPS**); both targets build, invariants match.
P2-2p8 remains RED / `IMPLEMENTED_NOT_ACCEPTED`. Main owns all edits/builds.
**OWNER INPUT 2026-09-16:** `docs/optimization/{FTR,STG,SRC,MISC}.md` (2,503
lines, source-grounded, UNMEASURED). SRC's top candidate is sized NO-GO above.
FTR/STG/MISC candidates are UNSIZED — size each against the profile before any
build; SRC.md's premises did not survive that step.
Review watermark: `Briefs/README.md` 2026-09-16; candidates stay with their rows.

Shared causes banked 2026-09-12 in `p2/BUG_NOTES.md` have rows below. Main owns
shared outputs/builds/timing; preserve other-owner 1P/CSS work. Settings stay
30 Hz menus and 1P active; all requirements and coverage stand.

Retained commits and scoped reports: `docs/archive/P2_CLOSED_ROWS.md`, section
"Retained P2 proofs (moved off the board 2026-09-16)".
HIGH stays reachable; stripping it is not authorized. Do not replace the published
P2 artifact above until the candidate's required gates pass.

## Queue — acceptance only

Ask for subjective owner checks only after the required measurable proof. Missing
pixels/audio or unexercised states stay engineering work.

- P2-1 shell presentation; P2-2 four-way camera, lower HUD, Team feel, Results, Sudden Death.
- P2-3: Mario/Luigi pipe (`r1`), Luigi animation (`r2`), intro visibility (`r5`), CSS preview rebuild (`r7`), Falcon/Samus feel.

## Queue — P2-3 engineering

| ID | Slice | Status | Next / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-3r17 | Fighter seams/holes around DK and Mario cap | **UN-DEFERRED 09-13; READY** | Raster coverage mismatch, not missing geometry; fix is a bounded AOT guard band in the owner generator. Analysis: `docs/BUGS.md`. |
| P2-3f33 | Link entry wave/beam + specials | **PARTIAL — source programs implemented** | Retain Catch proof. Open: entry beam alpha, SpecialN empty-hand/catch frames, air Spin, ThrowF/ThrowB; Neutral-B/Spin need isolated source-default requalification. |
| P2-3 Samus | Morph-ball source program closure | **IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY; engagement owed** | Programs 2/3 use roots `0x8158/0x8708`; Catch stays 1. CPU window 1,536 did not morph. Use source input for roll/Bomb. |
| P2-3f46 | Yoshi stress arm halts before its first sample | **BLOCKED behind P2-2p8** | Same tick-HUD ceiling as the four-CPU arm; resume with it. |
| P2-3f47 | Roster close: Ness, Jigglypuff and Kirby | **NDO6 + Kirby hat LANDED `1e80d39`; Kirby/Purin proofs OPEN** | Ness draws natively (nativefail 0). Open: Kirby copy-hat and Purin natural proofs, the image verifier's NORMAL re-bake with the image off (audit 14), alpha-zero guard; then the shell roster flip. |
| P2-3c1 | Exact pose clock | **WIRED; runtime differential/cost owed** | Binary32 clock replaces Q12 timing (`f6f65a…`); pose values stay Q12. Run `test_pose_clock_differential.py` through the ROM oracle and measure cost. |
| P2-3f52 | Yoshi grab, egg lay/throw, entry egg | **OPEN — no Yoshi root programs** | `OWNER_ROOT_PROGRAMS` has only samus/link. Derive from `247_YoshiMain.c` like Link Catch. |
| P2-3f53 | EFDesc effects without native owners | **OPEN** | Falcon Punch/Kick, Pikachu Thunder, Kirby Vulcan Jab, Yoshi shield: `generate_nds_entry_effects.py` roots + lookup + admission + check. |
| P2-3f54 | Weak stubs shadowing real bodies | **LANDED; runtime proof owed** | Wrappers + `itMainCheckShootNoAmmo` import; all six `T` in the shell ELF; atlas 4→5 sheets. |

## Queue — P2-4 engineering

| ID | Slice | Status | Next / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-4s1..s8 | All eight VS stages | **REOPENED — guard repair proven; visuals open** | BG2 wallpapers draw all eight. Hyrule/Inishie proof: `2026-09-14_stage-hazard-guards.md`; Jungle/Zebes/Yamabuki captures and Castle/Inishie texture defects remain. |
| P2-4n1 | Native stage packet and actors | **38 blob packets plus Dream Land linked; acceptance open** | Host tests pass. Barrel submits but is unproved on screen; Lakitu/Bronto open. Sector Z crash candidates ranked in `p2/BUG_NOTES.md`. |

## Queue — P2-5 items

| ID | Slice | Status | Next / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-5i1 | Item manager and twenty common items | **SOURCE PRESENT; Sword lifetime repair recorded** | Remaining kinds, children, states, interactions and full natural-path acceptance stay open. |
| P2-5i2 | The 13 Poke Ball Pokemon | **ALL 13 IN THE ROM; draw owners missing** | Dispatch proved (`gNdsItMonsterMakerMask` = `1fff`). Saffron monsters' VFX makers have no native owner. |
| P2-5i3 | Stage-spawned kinds | **8 OF 10 IN THE ROM; two behind the 1P flag** | Native owners exist for 1 of 42 item shapes. `MBallThrown` effect desc excluded on a false premise. |
| P2-5i4 | Pick up, throw, shoot and swing | **LANDED; acceptance open** | Pickup animation FileIDs resolved 09-09; `itMainCheckShootNoAmmo` weak stub in P2-3f54. |
| P2-5u1 | Item Switch and VS Options screens | **Entry/row repair committed** | `eafdf226c52`. Switch mask honoured by the spawn law; UI half uncensused. |
| P2-5x1 | Audio cue coverage | **SOURCE WIRED; ROM acceptance pending** | FGM header pins 573 entries over 47 banks; item TU audit clean (09-03/04). |

## Queue — P2-2 performance debt

| ID | Slice | Status | Next / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2-2p8 | Four-CPU renderer/performance, target `<1.12m` ticks | **STRUCTURAL BATCH FOCUS; RED** | Follow the Execution cursor. Retain applicable evidence; all scoped/integrated gates remain due. No universal PASS from one roster. |

## Queue discipline

- Keep only red/current/deferred/owner-acceptance summaries; move closed detail out at once; keep rows short enough to decide the next action. The 12,288-byte cap is enforced by `check-docs.ps1`: when it trips, archive, do not raise it.
- After verified progress, update the existing row and permanent evidence. Distinguish local candidates, reproducible commits and accepted scope. Bank durable findings out of gitignored `builds/` scratch before handoff; leave owner reports in `BUGS.md` unchanged.
- Worktree audit: 20 auxiliaries outside `.worktrees/`, 17 dirty/ambiguous. Create none; a cleanup cycle must hash-migrate evidence first. Clean candidates: `builds/p2-v4-index-worktree`, `.codex-worktrees/startup-oom-run`, `_s64_itcm_measure`.
