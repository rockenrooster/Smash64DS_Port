# P1 Execution Board

Updated: 2026-07-25 19:05 Central

Boundary: `battle_playable_realtime`, mode `163`

This is the only dynamic P1 queue. `PROJECT_GOAL.md` owns the milestone and
fidelity contract. `HANDOFF.md` owns restart commands, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` owns
durable gaps, `PERF_LEDGER.md` owns measurements and rejected experiments, and
`PORTING.md` is append-only history.

## Artifact Identity

Pinned public-build identity from `README.md`:

```text
smash64ds-battle-playable-hwtri.nds
11,428,864 bytes
SHA-256 4D795B4E83B335598B20A3B5953FDB1821797CC5E0A825FA96A0643ABBA4A090
```

Current local root artifact:

```text
smash64ds-battle-playable-hwtri.nds
11,421,696 bytes
SHA-256 A9ED45BC5DEF9DE71E00850E83DEB34AE46F4CB9B2CE19113E0548273C56F574
```

The worktree is dirty, so the local identity is informational only. It is not a
release candidate until the relevant verifier passes and the public-build pin is
updated in the same kept change.

## Red Queue

1. **Stable 30 FPS:** qualify representative active gameplay at
   P95 <= 1.12M ARM9 ticks per presented frame on the accuracy-focused custom
   melonDS fork. Hardware remains the final check for mechanisms the emulator
   cannot referee.
2. **Mario/Fox completeness:** replace battle-reachable weak status callbacks
   with source-backed behavior and prove both complete movesets naturally.
3. **Dream Land completeness:** close the remaining Whispy material/animation
   presentation debt without reintroducing gameplay-time texture conversion.
4. **Audio completeness:** implement or explicitly qualify every reachable
   voice, pitch schedule, composite cue, and overlapping match-audio path.
5. **Final acceptance:** run the CPU-on one-minute match, complete-match capture,
   owner play/listen pass, reserve gate, Results transition, and teardown proof
   on the exact candidate ROM.

Task 62's reduced DS-native static mesh remains a **REVERT**. A source-exact
follow-up now preserves material/UV/color/alpha and matches the flag-0 top
screen pixel-for-pixel, but submits the same 525 static vertices. The reduced
candidates have no run/material provenance, so the corrected Task 60/61 gates
recommend none. Keep `NDS_DREAMLAND_DS_MESH=0`; details and the earlier
CPU/GX reduction remain rejected-experiment evidence in
`optimization/archive/Task62_AB_Results.md`.

## Lane Ownership

| Surface | Owner |
|---|---|
| Goal, fidelity, milestone, definition of done | `PROJECT_GOAL.md` |
| Dynamic queue, artifact identity, blockers | this file |
| Exact restart surface and next packet | `HANDOFF.md` |
| Stable architecture | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Verification workflow | `VERIFYING.md` |
| Durable unresolved gaps | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| Measurements and rejected experiments | `PERF_LEDGER.md` |
| Chronological history | `PORTING.md` |

The current dirty Task 62 follow-up/runtime files are user-owned. Preserve them;
do not infer qualification or overwrite them during documentation cleanup.

## Acceptance Matrix

| Acceptance condition | State | Current evidence / blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Mario human vs original level-3 Fox CPU, Dream Land, one-minute Time, items off | Pass configuration | Boundary registry exposes only canonical mode 163 |
| Original Wait -> countdown -> GO, timer, scoring, Time Up, Results | Focused gates pass | Final exact-ROM CPU-on owner run remains red |
| Mario and Fox complete source-equivalent gameplay behavior | Red | Battle-reachable weak callbacks remain |
| Dream Land collision, platforms, blast zones, wind, camera | Pass for current P1 stage | Dynamic presentation debt remains red separately |
| Recognizable Dream Land presentation and required animation | Red | Whispy material/animation debt; Task 62 candidate rejected |
| Complete overlapping BGM, FGM, voices, announcer, crowd | Red | Exact pitch/composite/voice coverage and listen gates remain |
| Stable 30 FPS, representative P95 <= 1.12M ticks | Red | No current qualifying full-match result |
| Stable reserve, no corruption, clean teardown | Focused gates pass | Requalify after the final content/performance candidate |
| Reproducible public artifact | Red | Current local root ROM differs from the pinned public identity |

## Integration Rule

Keep only correctness-preserving, verifier-covered progress. Rendering may use
the fidelity budget in `PROJECT_GOAL.md`; gameplay must remain mechanically
equivalent to the original. Run the smallest relevant check, then one widest
relevant verifier for a kept checkpoint.
