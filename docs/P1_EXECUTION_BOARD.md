# P1 Execution Board

Updated: 2026-07-25 19:05 Central

Boundary: `battle_playable_realtime`, mode `163`

This is the only dynamic P1 queue. `PROJECT_GOAL.md` owns the milestone and
fidelity contract. `HANDOFF.md` owns restart commands, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` owns
durable gaps, `PERF_LEDGER.md` owns measurements and rejected experiments, and
`PORTING.md` is append-only history.

## Artifact Identity

Pinned public-build identity from `README.md`:

```text
smash64ds-battle-playable-hwtri.nds
11,428,864 bytes
SHA-256 4D795B4E83B335598B20A3B5953FDB1821797CC5E0A825FA96A0643ABBA4A090
```

Current local root artifact:

```text
smash64ds-battle-playable-hwtri.nds
11,421,696 bytes
SHA-256 A9ED45BC5DEF9DE71E00850E83DEB34AE46F4CB9B2CE19113E0548273C56F574
```

The worktree is dirty, so the local identity is informational only. It is not a
release candidate until the relevant verifier passes and the public-build pin is
updated in the same kept change.

## Red Queue

1. **Stable 30 FPS:** qualify representative active gameplay at
   P95 <= 1.12M ARM9 ticks per presented frame on the accuracy-focused custom
   melonDS fork. Hardware remains the final check for mechanisms the emulator
   cannot referee.
2. **Mario/Fox completeness:** replace battle-reachable weak status callbacks
   with source-backed behavior and prove both complete movesets naturally.
3. **Dream Land completeness:** close the remaining Whispy material/animation
   presentation debt without reintroducing gameplay-time texture conversion.
4. **Audio completeness:** implement or explicitly qualify every reachable
   voice, pitch schedule, composite cue, and overlapping match-audio path.
5. **Final acceptance:** run the CPU-on one-minute match, complete-match capture,
   owner play/listen pass, reserve gate, Results transition, and teardown proof
   on the exact candidate ROM.

**Performance lane (2026-07-27):** `WORK-H` P95 **1,647,424** after Task 104,
against the 1,120,000 gate. Two search spaces are closed by measurement — exactness-preserving
(Tasks 78–96) and visual approximation in its payload form (Tasks 98–99). The
raster axis was opened in `optimization/RASTER_AXIS_CAMPAIGN.md` and **Task 100
closed it at the first test** — a quarter of the frame's pixels stopped being
drawn and `STG` moved −320 against a ≥40,000 criterion, for the architectural
reason that the DS rasterizer consumes already-swapped polygon RAM and cannot
stall the CPU. Pixels join words and triangles; do not propose another fill,
coverage, AA or overdraw lever.

**Task 103 ran and moved the lane.** Partitioning `STG` in place found that
Tasks 51–55, 99 and 100 all worked the run loop, which is only 35% of the
bucket; **61% (238,254 ticks/frame) is outside the segment commit entirely, in
the owner prepare path, and has never been profiled.** It also found the 21
generic runs the Task 36 replay does not serve cost 63,903 ticks for 103
triangles, and that GX words cost 9.51 ticks each — retiring Task 55 E2's "words
are free" as a below-noise null.

E3/E4 then closed the attribution exactly — all four writers of
`gNdsTickHudStageTicks` tapped with zero added instrument, partition closing to
192 ticks (0.05%) against the build's own `STG`.

**Task 104 took the first cut out of it — KEEP, default on, Boundary green.**
On each of the three Task 36 replay-hit segments the owner cleared a 1,292-byte
`NDSRendererStats` and then overwrote all 1,292 bytes with a copy, to transport
**four live bytes** (`sync_command_count`, the only member read after the segment
loop). Eliding both accesses: `STG` P50 **−22,016**, `WORK-H` P50 **−26,240**,
P95 **−28,352**, VBlank 4-interval **39 → 28**, `FTR` flat. `WORK-H` P95 is now
**1,647,424**. Detail in `optimization/ClaudeOpus5_Task104_FourLiveBytes_20260727.md`.

That result also explains Task 103 E7's 28% realisation and produced a standing
rule: **size a memory lever by bytes that stop being touched, not instructions
that stop executing** — removing one of two accesses to the same cache lines
relocates the misses rather than eliminating them.

**Task 105 then closed the rest of that axis at E0, for one census run and no
builds.** `memset`'s residue is ~16,018 ticks split five ways (Task 84 E1.3
priced `InitStats` at 72% of the family's time), and a re-attributed `memcpy`
census found ~294 matrix copies/frame across five sites worth 3,300–10,600
nominal each — every one discounting to 1,000–3,000 under Task 104's own rule,
below the floor. Two rows in that census are inlined-range artifacts and are
marked as such. **The memory-traffic axis is harvested;** the residue is
structural, in `NDSRendererMatrix20p12` being 4×4/64 B for affine transforms the
DS loads as 4×3/48 B, and is not worth a Runtime 1 refactor.

**Task 106/107 E0 then sized the last untested large lever and re-aimed the
lane.** A 30 Hz simulation (`NDS_TASK106_UPDATES_PER_PRESENT=1`, default 2,
nothing shipped) is worth `WORK-H` P50 −158,592, taking the median to
**1,119,616 — 384 ticks under the gate**. But `WORK-H` P95 falls only −119,744,
because the `SRC` excursion above its own median is **+518,016 on the control
and +522,720 on the candidate — unchanged**. Halving the update rate halves
median `SRC` and leaves its tail intact: the excursion is asset loading driven
by animation events, and fewer update ticks do not reduce how many distinct
animations a match loads.

**The gate is a tail statistic, and Task 75 E0 has now measured what owns it.**
A load counter at `ndsRelocFinalizeLoadedFile`, ringed per frame, discharges
Task 71 §5's obligation — and answers it **no**. All 5 load frames in the window
are `SRC` excursions, so a load is *sufficient*; but **2 of the 7 excursions
carry no cartridge activity at all** (frames 453 and 454, at 2.0× and 1.9× the
`SRC` median), so a load is *not necessary*. The counter cross-validates against
the independent native-owner counter exactly (7 loads, `animLoad:7`).

Sized against the distribution rather than one frame: `WORK-H` P95 is 1,656,896
over all frames and **1,553,408 over load-free frames only**, so eliminating
on-demand loading is worth **~103,488** — 19% of the 536,896 gap, against Task 71
§5's extrapolated ~170,000. And the resulting P95 would be frame 454, a load-free
excursion, so the preload buys 103,488 and hands the gate to an unidentified
cause.

**Highest-value unowned row: profile a load-free `SRC` excursion.** Frame 453 —
single-frame spike, `SRC` 636,096, zero loads, no fallback, `FTR`/`STG` at
median. Task 71's per-PC census windowed on the frame is the instrument; its own
window (469–470) contained a load, so this population has never been profiled.
Whether the residual shares a cause with the loads (relocation, figatree parse)
decides whether one fix serves both and whether the preload's ceiling is higher
than 103,488. Row 51's preload bridge is real but must not start as a subsystem
against 19% of the gap.

Stage levers, still unowned, now second in priority:

1. **The `PrepareRun` head — 67,119 ticks/frame over 21 calls**, the largest
   block inside `ndsRendererPrepareNativeStageOwner` (now ~138,600 after Task
   104) that nothing has attacked. Long span, so the sizing is trustworthy.
   Task 81's closed stage memo does **not** cover it: that was a texture-identity
   memo at the bind seam, and Task 81 measured zero stage texture binds in
   battle. **Highest-value unowned row on the board.**
2. **`ndsRendererAdapterPrepareNativeStageMatrices` — 55,077 ticks/frame at one
   call per frame.** Never profiled; same in-place span method.
3. **Bring the 21 generic stage runs under the Task 36 replay** — 63,607
   ticks/frame for 103 triangles, less the replay's own ~1,785/run. Note this
   cannot be done by widening `NDS_TASK36_REPLAY_SEGMENT_MASK`, which would
   freeze dynamic stage geometry; mode 2 replays complete rigid segments only.

(1) and (2) are per-frame preparation over a topology Task 44 has already proven
unchanged, which is the shape an incremental update attacks. With one call per
frame there is no per-run transfer problem of the kind that killed Task 79 E1.

Task 62's reduced DS-native static mesh remains a **REVERT**. A source-exact
follow-up now preserves material/UV/color/alpha and matches the flag-0 top
screen pixel-for-pixel, but submits the same 525 static vertices. The reduced
candidates have no run/material provenance, so the corrected Task 60/61 gates
recommend none. Keep `NDS_DREAMLAND_DS_MESH=0`; details and the earlier
CPU/GX reduction remain rejected-experiment evidence in
`optimization/archive/Task62_AB_Results.md`.

The current dirty Task 62 follow-up/runtime files are user-owned. Preserve them;
do not infer qualification or overwrite them during documentation cleanup.

## Acceptance Matrix

| Mario and Fox complete source-equivalent gameplay behavior | Red | Battle-reachable weak callbacks remain |
| Dream Land collision, platforms, blast zones, wind, camera | Pass for current P1 stage | Dynamic presentation debt remains red separately |
| Recognizable Dream Land presentation and required animation | Red | Whispy material/animation debt; Task 62 candidate rejected |
| Complete overlapping BGM, FGM, voices, announcer, crowd | Red | Exact pitch/composite/voice coverage and listen gates remain |
| Stable 30 FPS, representative P95 <= 1.12M ticks | Red | No current qualifying full-match result |
| Stable reserve, no corruption, clean teardown | Focused gates pass | Requalify after the final content/performance candidate |
| Reproducible public artifact | Red | Current local root ROM differs from the pinned public identity |

## Integration Rule

Keep only correctness-preserving, verifier-covered progress. Rendering may use
the fidelity budget in `PROJECT_GOAL.md`; gameplay must remain mechanically
equivalent to the original. Run the smallest relevant check, then one widest
relevant verifier for a kept checkpoint.
