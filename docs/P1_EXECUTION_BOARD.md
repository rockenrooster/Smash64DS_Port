# P1 Execution Board

Updated: 2026-07-27 22:45 Central

Boundary: `battle_playable_realtime`, mode `163`

This is the only dynamic P1 queue. `PROJECT_GOAL.md` owns the milestone and
fidelity contract. `HANDOFF.md` owns restart commands, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` owns
durable gaps, `PERF_LEDGER.md` owns measurements and rejected experiments, and
`PORTING.md` is append-only history.

The worktree is dirty, so the local identity is informational only. It is not a
release candidate until the relevant verifier passes and the public-build pin is
updated in the same kept change.

## Runtime 2 (2026-07-27)

The owner approved `Smash64DS_Runtime2_SwitchPlan.md` and it is now the live
renderer direction; `optimization/archive/NATIVE_RENDERER_PLAN.md` is history.
R2 phases are rows here, measured under `TASK_STANDING_RULES.md`.

**R2-02's §7 gate is NOT met. E3 is retracted and E4 refuted the whole
approach.** `STG` P50 stands at **224,320** after E1a and E2, **44,320 over** the
provisional 180K budget. §3.1 and §7 forbid carrying a phase that misses its
budget into the next one, so **R2-03 was started prematurely** and its queue
below is sizing only, not licence to build. The two soft-float files named
`R2-03` are Runtime 1 harvest, not that phase; they are corrected in place per
the never-rename rule.

                                                faster)
```

**The mechanism, established by E4** —
`optimization/ClaudeOpus5_R202_E4_ActorSegmentsRefuted_20260728.md`. A **rigid**
binding's captured stream is `PUSH` + `MULT4x4` of a constant world under the
camera the segment bracket loads live every frame, so it replays. A **dynamic**
binding's stream is a `MATRIX_LOAD4x4` per triangle of projection × view × model,
so replaying it pins that geometry to the camera the capture frame happened to
have — which is exactly why the flowers sat in a fixed screen band under every
camera. Hence the invariant, now written into both masks:

> `NDS_TASK36_REPLAY_SEGMENT_MASK` must name exactly the segments whose every
> binding is in `NDS_RENDERER_TASK36_RIGID_BINDING_MASK`.

E3 broke it by widening one mask. E4 arm C restored it by widening both — and
lost the flower beds anyway, for an unrelated reason: **the rigid emit path is
single-binding by construction.** `ndsRendererNativeStageEmitNoZTriangle` drops
a triangle whose corners are not all bound to the run's own binding, and the two
flower beds are the only cross-matrix geometry on Dream Land — 10 of their 15
triangles. That is the `cross_matrix_triangles=10` that
`M3_NATIVE_STAGE_CHECK_OK` prints on every Boundary run, and it had been on
screen the whole time.

It is also why the flowers are expensive: a cross-matrix triangle falls to the
generic tail, which loads a composed matrix **once per vertex**. 15 flower
triangles cost 35 matrix loads a frame; Whispy's 12 single-binding triangles cost
12.

Two hypotheses died cheaply on the host and should have died before E3 landed:
every actor triangle carries coordinate shift 0 (so Task 51's missing shift
compensation is irrelevant), and `NDS_TASK51_STAGE_NATIVE` defaults to 0 and is
compiled out of every ROM measured (so E3's premise — "Task 51 already baked
those world matrices" — was false).

**Nothing shipped.** `NDS_R2_STAGE_ACTORS` is deleted. The published ROMs are at
defaults and Boundary-green at **62.750%**, `stage_body` green 44.848% / detail
52.242%. One real defect was found and kept: replay asserted
`task36_local_pushed = TRUE` for every run, so each admitted actor segment bought
an unmatched `glPopMatrix(1)`. Capture now records the run's actual `PUSH`/`POP`
balance.

**The stage partition, measured 2026-07-28** (`census-stage-run-phases.ps1`,
frames 439–499, defaults build so `NDS_R2_STAGE_DIRECT`/`DMA` are off; total
401,506). This is the list the remaining 44,320 has to come out of:

**Read this against §7's actual instruction, which has not been followed.**
R2-02 says the static majority becomes *"a fully direct owned path: no generic
preflight, no stats temporaries, no per-frame texture resolution; the runtime
shape is `DreamLand_Run17()`, not discover/validate/rebuild/resolve/prepare/
submit"*. E1a, E2, E3, E4 and E5 all optimised the discover/validate/prepare
pipeline instead of replacing it. Segment 0 already has the prescribed shape —
`ndsRendererNativeStagePrepareGeneratedSegment0`, gated by
`NDS_NATIVE_STAGE_GENERATED_SEGMENT0_ENABLE`. Segments 1–7 do not. **Extending
that generated program to the remaining segments is the phase's own design and
is the credible lever §8 asks for before any budget is relaxed.**

Ranked by size, and all of it is preflight the direct path deletes rather than
optimises:

1. `prepare matrices` **54,242** — `ndsRendererAdapterPrepareInitialMatrices`
   walks each dynamic binding's DObj parent chain every frame. The flowers'
   worlds are provably constant (E4 arm C: the runtime rigid-constancy check
   accepted them), so this is recomputing a known-constant world and then
   composing the camera onto it. Splitting camera from world is what Task 36
   already does for the 26 rigid bindings via `MULT4x4` under a once-loaded
   camera. Largest single item and the most clearly structural.
2. `apply state span` **30,117** — 21 calls E1a's `r2_reuse` memo does not
   cover, because it sits outside that guard. Careful: it mutates the running
   `state` that later runs consume, so it cannot be skipped per-run without
   also proving the successor's incoming state.
3. `init stats + traversal` **16,793** — a 1,292-byte blanket clear plus
   traversal init, 5× a frame, for the five segments Task 104's elision does not
   reach. §3.4 names this shape explicitly; extend Task 104's pattern.
4. `unattributed` **18,004** inside the owner span — uncensused, and bigger than
   item 3. Bracket it before assuming it is small.

Items 1–3 total 101,152 against a 44,320 requirement, so the budget is reachable
without relaxing it — the work is structural, not another memo.

**Also on this row — de-cross the flowers in the generator.** For each of the 15
foreign corners emit a duplicate dense vertex pre-transformed into the run's
binding space (`v' = W_run⁻¹ · W_foreign · v`, a compile-time transform because
both worlds are constant). That is +15 dense vertices, no new runs or triangles,
and it makes every flower triangle single-binding. Only then widen
`NDS_RENDERER_TASK36_RIGID_BINDING_MASK` and `NDS_TASK36_REPLAY_SEGMENT_MASK`
together; gate the transform on the Task 49 Tier-2 differ (the inverse-multiply
is where fixed-point error enters); verify with a frame-locked crop of segments 3
and 6 plus a triangle count and `task36_runtime_rigid_mask` read from the run
that produced the buckets. Whispy (20–24) is out of scope — materially animated,
and at 12 single-binding triangles it was never the expensive half.

**The two surviving R2-02 flags are still default-off and the published ROMs are
unchanged.** `AGENTS.md` makes the owner the visual oracle for render-side work,
so graduating `NDS_R2_STAGE_DIRECT` / `NDS_R2_STAGE_DMA` to default-on is the
owner's call. **This is the ask that matters most on this board:** the shipping
ROM is running at 3 VBlanks where those two flags put it at 2.

**What else is left in the stage.** layer1 (segment 4) is 22,738 ticks/frame for
76 triangles and is still generic: its six runs submit through the raw composed
matrix (binding 29, submit classes 0 and 6), which is the camera and genuinely
moves. Moving it onto the segment-bracket path is generator work worth ~19,000 —
now the *largest* remaining stage lever, and still not enough for the gate alone.

**R2-03 is owned; E0–E3 are done and the target is named.** The frame is
re-baselined on the post-R2-02 program: **REAL WORK 1,264,844 against the
1,120,000 budget, gap 144,844** (it was 407,000 at Task 65).

**The sizing is finished and the target is one span: fighter matrix
preparation, 91,338 ticks/frame — 63% of the gap.**
`ndsFighterMarioFoxDLAllDrawForSlot` costs 497,231 ticks/frame inclusive (the
census's 37,206 is self time); the split is walk 3,138, reset 6,675,
revalidation 9,916, owner prep 113,855 (**matrix 91,338** + material 21,504),
submit and tail 361,936. Two independent builds agree to 0.6%.

Three named mechanisms cover 93% of the gap: fighter matrix prep 91,338,
fighter material prep 21,504, stage layer1 22,738. The matrix half is not a
memo — the pose moves every frame — it is §7's generated per-epoch submit
consuming baked facts, and soft-float's 177,503 is largely the same ticks
counted another way (the source's joint transforms are float; the render side
converts them to 20.12 every frame). The material half *may* be a memo and
deserves the E3 falsifier first, at one build for ~21,500.
`optimization/ClaudeOpus5_R203_E4_MatrixPrepIsTheTarget_20260728.md`.

Two candidates were closed on the way, both with evidence rather than opinion:
the shade loop is **not** a memo (inputs and outputs both changed on 1,796 of
1,835 frames), and walk + revalidation is 4% of the function, not the 37% a
self-time-versus-inclusive mix-up made it look like.

**R2-03 E1 took `sqrtf` from 15,760 to 9,720 ticks/frame, −6,040**, bit-exact
against IEEE over 8.7M checked inputs, Boundary green. The 8-frame A/B read
**flat on every bucket** — the saving sits inside the 5,000–7,000 placement
floor, and the symbol census is what resolved it. That constructive half is now
in `TASK_STANDING_RULES.md`: when the predicted saving is near the floor, gate
on the census, which times the function directly and has no placement term.

Only 38% though, not the 17× the hardware's 13-cycle latency suggests: libnds's
`sqrt64` is write / **poll-busy** / write / **poll-busy** / read, and the I/O
polling costs about what the software root did. **On this hardware a coprocessor
is only worth it if the result can be collected without spinning on it.**

**R2-02 E1a took `STG` P50 −94,784, down on 128/128 frames**, and 4-VBlank
frames fell 50 → 12 out of 566. Boundary green; required-region detail 62.792%
vs 62.778%. `NDS_R2_STAGE_DIRECT`, default 0, owner visual approval outstanding.
`STG` is now 256,704 against the frozen 180K budget — gap 76,704, was 171,488.
E2 is `ndsRendererAdapterPrepareNativeStageMatrices` (55,077 bracketed), which
is **not** frame-invariant: the camera moves, so a reuse key will not work
there and E0's sizing method does not transfer.

### CLOSED — the gate metric is sound (R2-00c, 2026-07-27)

**R2-00a's phantom-work finding is refuted, and the row it opened is closed.**
It compared halt measured in a profile ROM against `WAIT` measured in a
different tick-HUD ROM; placement differs between builds, so a frame index does
not name the same workload in both. One ROM carrying both instruments
(`NDS_TASK37_PROFILE_PER_FRAME_REGION=1`, new) settles it over 128 frames of one
run: `ALL` agrees to **0.04%**, `WAIT` to a constant **−851 ticks/frame**, and
the 27 excursion frames (median −860) are no different from the other 100
(median −847). `WORK-H` P95 is not inflated by a mis-scoped bracket; the 1.12M
gap is real. Evidence:
`optimization/ClaudeOpus5_R200c_WaitBracketAudit_20260727.md`.

**What replaced it is a real optimization row.** The excursion is genuine
execution — `armWaitForIrq` falls 323,450 ticks/frame and **+286,619** of work
takes its place, on 21% of frames — and the same per-frame regions attribute it:
softfloat ~49,600, **the tick HUD measuring itself ~44,300**, cart read +
relocation + bulk copy ~36,000, geometry submission ~14,500, collision ~5,700,
animation ~2,700, then a diffuse tail over ~59,000 PCs. Four unrelated causes on
the same frames, which is why five previous tasks found no single mechanism.

Two consequences worth acting on:

- **The frames are not load-free.** `_ntrcardRecvByCpu` + `ntrcardRomRead` are
  12,639 ticks/frame higher there. Task 75's preload targets something real, but
  its ~103,488 estimate must be re-derived against the measured ~36,000.
- **`WORK-H` cannot remove all of the instrument.** `ndsPlatformTickHudSample()`
  runs after the buckets are latched, so the percentile sort (19,605
  ticks/frame) lands in the *next* frame's `ALL`. ~2% of the P95, not 33%, but
  it is the metric charging the ROM for being measured.

R2-00a's other findings stand: no GX, DMA or cart *stall*; ledger closed;
bit-identical reproduction of the prior census.

### The frame, re-ranked on attribution that holds (R2-00c §7)

`task65_subsystem_census.py` named functions with `addr2line -f`, which resolves
through DWARF — and DWARF still describes functions the linker
garbage-collected. It charged 24,240 ticks/frame to `ndsRendererTask29GXRecord`,
which is not in the binary. The census now bisects the ELF symbol table and
overrides addr2line; that **renames 18,987 of 59,366 PCs, 32%**. Aggregates
survive (REAL WORK 1,446,638 vs R2-00b's 1,446,348, 0.02%); the per-symbol table
did not, and that is what targets are picked from.

| group | ticks/frame | % of work | cyc/insn |
|---|---|---|---|
| soft-float | **177,857** | **12.3%** | 1.19 |
| matrix | **156,627** | **10.8%** | 2.35 |
| gx-submit | 144,852 | 10.0% | 2.72 |
| texture-resolve | 108,681 | 7.5% | 4.91 |
| `mem*` | 98,207 | 6.8% | 2.60 |

**Soft-float is the largest block and it is not stalled** — 1.19 cyc/insn, and
`__aeabi_fadd` is already hand-written ITCM assembly. Nothing to win by making
it faster; the only lever is calling it less, i.e. float→fixed at the call sites
in imported gameplay and animation. **Matrix construction is 156,627, not the
55,077 R2-02 E2 was sized at** — the bracket saw one call, the census sees seven
symbols across stage and fighter. Re-scope E2 against that.

The attributor is installed repo-local at
`emulators/melonds-attributor/melonDS.exe` (`D81FC0BF…`) rather than replacing
`emulators/melonds/melonDS.exe`, so measurements taken with `DE80E46B…` stay
comparable. `check-melonds-policy.ps1` passes with it present.

**R2-00b replaced the stale Task 65 baseline.** REAL WORK is **1,446,348**
ticks/frame, not 1,527,277; the gap to the 1.12M gate is **326,348**, not
407,277. Stall is 62.1% of work (memory 555,943, non-memory 342,494), so the
architectural premise is unchanged — memory stall alone still exceeds the whole
gap.

It also corrected an attribution defect Task 65 shipped: `task65_subsystem_census.py`
filed `src/port/reloc_backend_renderer_dl.c` under `PORT/reloc`, charging
**147,777 ticks/frame of renderer adapter work to a bucket named after
loading.** Corrected, **the renderer is 723,554 ticks/frame — 50.0% of the
frame's work** — and all gameplay is 190,649 (13.2%). Any plan built on Task
65's §2 table under-counted the renderer by that amount.

Note for every future phase gate: the census attributes by where code lives and
the tick-HUD buckets attribute by bracket. They are not interchangeable, and the
shared kernels (616,701 ticks/frame) are what differ between them. State which
view a gate quotes.

## Red Queue

1. **Stable 30 FPS:** qualify representative active gameplay at
   P95 <= 1.12M ARM9 ticks per presented frame on the accuracy-focused custom
   melonDS fork. Hardware remains the final check for mechanisms the emulator
   cannot referee.
2. **Mario/Fox completeness:** replace battle-reachable weak status callbacks
   with source-backed behavior and prove both complete movesets naturally.
3. **Dream Land completeness:** close the remaining Whispy material/animation
   presentation debt without reintroducing gameplay-time texture conversion.
4. **Audio completeness:** implement or explicitly qualify every reachable
   voice, pitch schedule, composite cue, and overlapping match-audio path.
5. **Final acceptance:** run the CPU-on one-minute match, complete-match capture,
   owner play/listen pass, reserve gate, Results transition, and teardown proof
   on the exact candidate ROM.

**Performance lane (2026-07-27):** `WORK-H` P95 **1,647,424** after Task 104,
against the 1,120,000 gate. Two search spaces are closed by measurement — exactness-preserving
(Tasks 78–96) and visual approximation in its payload form (Tasks 98–99). The
raster axis was opened in `optimization/RASTER_AXIS_CAMPAIGN.md` and **Task 100
closed it at the first test** — a quarter of the frame's pixels stopped being
drawn and `STG` moved −320 against a ≥40,000 criterion, for the architectural
reason that the DS rasterizer consumes already-swapped polygon RAM and cannot
stall the CPU. Pixels join words and triangles; do not propose another fill,
coverage, AA or overdraw lever.

**Task 103 ran and moved the lane.** Partitioning `STG` in place found that
Tasks 51–55, 99 and 100 all worked the run loop, which is only 35% of the
bucket; **61% (238,254 ticks/frame) is outside the segment commit entirely, in
the owner prepare path, and has never been profiled.** It also found the 21
generic runs the Task 36 replay does not serve cost 63,903 ticks for 103
triangles, and that GX words cost 9.51 ticks each — retiring Task 55 E2's "words
are free" as a below-noise null.

E3/E4 then closed the attribution exactly — all four writers of
`gNdsTickHudStageTicks` tapped with zero added instrument, partition closing to
192 ticks (0.05%) against the build's own `STG`.

**Task 104 took the first cut out of it — KEEP, default on, Boundary green.**
On each of the three Task 36 replay-hit segments the owner cleared a 1,292-byte
`NDSRendererStats` and then overwrote all 1,292 bytes with a copy, to transport
**four live bytes** (`sync_command_count`, the only member read after the segment
loop). Eliding both accesses: `STG` P50 **−22,016**, `WORK-H` P50 **−26,240**,
P95 **−28,352**, VBlank 4-interval **39 → 28**, `FTR` flat. `WORK-H` P95 is now
**1,647,424**. Detail in `optimization/ClaudeOpus5_Task104_FourLiveBytes_20260727.md`.

That result also explains Task 103 E7's 28% realisation and produced a standing
rule: **size a memory lever by bytes that stop being touched, not instructions
that stop executing** — removing one of two accesses to the same cache lines
relocates the misses rather than eliminating them.

**Task 105 then closed the rest of that axis at E0, for one census run and no
builds.** `memset`'s residue is ~16,018 ticks split five ways (Task 84 E1.3
priced `InitStats` at 72% of the family's time), and a re-attributed `memcpy`
census found ~294 matrix copies/frame across five sites worth 3,300–10,600
nominal each — every one discounting to 1,000–3,000 under Task 104's own rule,
below the floor. Two rows in that census are inlined-range artifacts and are
marked as such. **The memory-traffic axis is harvested;** the residue is
structural, in `NDSRendererMatrix20p12` being 4×4/64 B for affine transforms the
DS loads as 4×3/48 B, and is not worth a Runtime 1 refactor.

**Task 106/107 E0 then sized the last untested large lever and re-aimed the
lane.** A 30 Hz simulation (`NDS_TASK106_UPDATES_PER_PRESENT=1`, default 2,
nothing shipped) is worth `WORK-H` P50 −158,592, taking the median to
**1,119,616 — 384 ticks under the gate**. But `WORK-H` P95 falls only −119,744,
because the `SRC` excursion above its own median is **+518,016 on the control
and +522,720 on the candidate — unchanged**. Halving the update rate halves
median `SRC` and leaves its tail intact: the excursion is asset loading driven
by animation events, and fewer update ticks do not reduce how many distinct
animations a match loads.

**The gate is a tail statistic, and Task 75 E0 has now measured what owns it.**
A load counter at `ndsRelocFinalizeLoadedFile`, ringed per frame, discharges
Task 71 §5's obligation — and answers it **no**. All 5 load frames in the window
are `SRC` excursions, so a load is *sufficient*; but **2 of the 7 excursions
carry no cartridge activity at all** (frames 453 and 454, at 2.0× and 1.9× the
`SRC` median), so a load is *not necessary*. The counter cross-validates against
the independent native-owner counter exactly (7 loads, `animLoad:7`).

Sized against the distribution rather than one frame: `WORK-H` P95 is 1,656,896
over all frames and **1,553,408 over load-free frames only**, so eliminating
on-demand loading is worth **~103,488** — 19% of the 536,896 gap, against Task 71
§5's extrapolated ~170,000. And the resulting P95 would be frame 454, a load-free
excursion, so the preload buys 103,488 and hands the gate to an unidentified
cause.

**Highest-value unowned row: profile a load-free `SRC` excursion.** Frame 453 —
single-frame spike, `SRC` 636,096, zero loads, no fallback, `FTR`/`STG` at
median. Task 71's per-PC census windowed on the frame is the instrument; its own
window (469–470) contained a load, so this population has never been profiled.
Whether the residual shares a cause with the loads (relocation, figatree parse)
decides whether one fix serves both and whether the preload's ceiling is higher
than 103,488. Row 51's preload bridge is real but must not start as a subsystem
against 19% of the gap.

Stage levers, still unowned, now second in priority:

1. **The `PrepareRun` head — 67,119 ticks/frame over 21 calls**, the largest
   block inside `ndsRendererPrepareNativeStageOwner` (now ~138,600 after Task
   104) that nothing has attacked. Long span, so the sizing is trustworthy.
   Task 81's closed stage memo does **not** cover it: that was a texture-identity
   memo at the bind seam, and Task 81 measured zero stage texture binds in
   battle. **Highest-value unowned row on the board.**
2. **`ndsRendererAdapterPrepareNativeStageMatrices` — 55,077 ticks/frame at one
   call per frame.** Never profiled; same in-place span method.
3. **Bring the 21 generic stage runs under the Task 36 replay** — 63,607
   ticks/frame for 103 triangles, less the replay's own ~1,785/run. Note this
   cannot be done by widening `NDS_TASK36_REPLAY_SEGMENT_MASK`, which would
   freeze dynamic stage geometry; mode 2 replays complete rigid segments only.

(1) and (2) are per-frame preparation over a topology Task 44 has already proven
unchanged, which is the shape an incremental update attacks. With one call per
frame there is no per-run transfer problem of the kind that killed Task 79 E1.

Task 62's reduced DS-native static mesh remains a **REVERT**. A source-exact
follow-up now preserves material/UV/color/alpha and matches the flag-0 top
screen pixel-for-pixel, but submits the same 525 static vertices. The reduced
candidates have no run/material provenance, so the corrected Task 60/61 gates
recommend none. Keep `NDS_DREAMLAND_DS_MESH=0`; details and the earlier
CPU/GX reduction remain rejected-experiment evidence in
`optimization/archive/Task62_AB_Results.md`.

## Lane Ownership

| Surface | Owner |
|---|---|
| Goal, fidelity, milestone, definition of done | `PROJECT_GOAL.md` |
| Dynamic queue, artifact identity, blockers | this file |
| Exact restart surface and next packet | `HANDOFF.md` |
| Stable architecture | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Verification workflow | `VERIFYING.md` |
| Durable unresolved gaps | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| Measurements and rejected experiments | `PERF_LEDGER.md` |
| Chronological history | `PORTING.md` |

The current dirty Task 62 follow-up/runtime files are user-owned. Preserve them;
do not infer qualification or overwrite them during documentation cleanup.

## Acceptance Matrix

| Acceptance condition | State | Current evidence / blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Mario human vs original level-3 Fox CPU, Dream Land, one-minute Time, items off | Pass configuration | Boundary registry exposes only canonical mode 163 |
| Original Wait -> countdown -> GO, timer, scoring, Time Up, Results | Focused gates pass | Final exact-ROM CPU-on owner run remains red |
| Mario and Fox complete source-equivalent gameplay behavior | Red | Battle-reachable weak callbacks remain |
| Dream Land collision, platforms, blast zones, wind, camera | Pass for current P1 stage | Dynamic presentation debt remains red separately |
| Recognizable Dream Land presentation and required animation | Red | Whispy material/animation debt; Task 62 candidate rejected |
| Complete overlapping BGM, FGM, voices, announcer, crowd | Red | Exact pitch/composite/voice coverage and listen gates remain |
| Stable 30 FPS, representative P95 <= 1.12M ticks | Red | No current qualifying full-match result |
| Stable reserve, no corruption, clean teardown | Focused gates pass | Requalify after the final content/performance candidate |
| Reproducible public artifact | Red | Current local root ROM differs from the pinned public identity |

## Integration Rule

Keep only correctness-preserving, verifier-covered progress. Rendering may use
the fidelity budget in `PROJECT_GOAL.md`; gameplay must remain mechanically
equivalent to the original. Run the smallest relevant check, then one widest
relevant verifier for a kept checkpoint.
