# Bug investigation notes (P2 repair queue)

Working notes behind `docs/BUGS.md`, which stays the lean owner-facing queue
(`docs/BUG_FIXING_PROCESS.md`). One entry per queue row that has evidence
worth keeping; append, do not rewrite history.

## Menus

- **VS Options crash (2026-09-06):** native round trip passes; owner accepted
  VS Options, Option and Backup Clear visually. Cadence and save-behaviour
  verification stay separate rows.

## CSS

- **Link torso (2026-09-06, `5bc1f461f90`):** camera-correct reflection state
  restores the full native CSS model; evidence
  `artifacts/performance/2026-09-06_css-link-reflection/`.
- **Yoshi invisible (2026-09-06):** three seams. (1) `FTCommonPart.flags` sat
  in the high lane after the file's u32 swap, so every Yoshi joint dispatched
  as case 0 and drew nothing; `ndsRelocNormalizeFighterCommonPartFlags`
  restores the byte (host test `test_common_part_flags.py`). (2) The bake
  published the compiler-extended payload size (0xb1b0) and synthetic weld
  offsets; it now publishes the raw 0xace0 and the source post-list
  identities (`test_native_root_identity.py`). (3) With case 1 live, each
  pre-matrix `dls[0]` became its own contract event: `gcPrepDObjMatrix` now
  credits it to the joint it precedes by identity, and the collection folds
  it into that joint's welded post root. Natural CSS selection validates
  18/18 roots; evidence `artifacts/performance/2026-09-06_css-yoshi-native/`,
  `artifacts/visibility/2026-09-06_css-yoshi-pre-list.png`. Battle/stress
  acceptance and Win2 pose coverage remain open.
- **Pikachu ears (2026-09-06):** not matrices, topology or admission (GX clip
  matrices for the ear roots equal head x ear offset; prepared vertices match
  the bake; a cull-none poke made the ears appear as back faces). The ears
  are a 12x1 CI4 ramp tile (`SETTILESIZE` lrs 11, lrt 0, both axes
  `G_TX_CLAMP`) uploaded as 16x8; the bilinear texcoord offset puts every ear
  texel at t~1.1, which the RDP clamps to row 0 but the DS reads from the
  zeroed padding row, and the PAL16 packer publishes zero as transparent
  colour 0. `ndsRendererHardwareReplicateClampPadding` replicates the tile
  edge across the padding of a clamped axis. Evidence
  `artifacts/performance/2026-09-06_css-pikachu-ears/` (before / generic
  control / after). Battle acceptance and a wider texture regression pass
  remain.
- **Kirby / Jigglypuff / Ness:** `NDS_P2_SHELL_ROSTER` ladder (Makefile:656,
  685-693) stops at rung 7; rung 8 loads ten closures (904,656 B) and hung in
  libfat `get_fat` on the CSS transition. The lazy-load patch hung the shell
  walk and was reversed (`builds/resume-20260905/agents-0906/css_arena_budget.final.md`,
  `css_arena_residency.final.md`).

## Stages

- **Missing BG on all eight (2026-09-06):** every stage wallpaper container
  shares Dream Land's layout, but only Dream Land's Sprite header was
  byte-lane normalized after load (`ndsRelocNormalizeStageDreamLandSprite`
  keyed on one asset id), so the other eight failed the shape gate and seeded
  nothing. The normalizer now covers every wallpaper asset id. Castle and
  Hyrule seed READY (state 2, 42,834 opaque pixels, distinct hashes):
  `artifacts/visibility/2026-09-06_stage-wallpaper-{castle,hyrule}.png`;
  probe `builds/resume-20260905/stage-qa/stage-wallpaper-probe.ps1`.
- **Slow renderer on all eight (`ab3a8f083e4`, `4f8d9a30392`,
  `4099abddd50`, 2026-09-07):** native admission declined every blob stage
  with reason 6: the blob maxima header was never generated (Makefile
  dependency on `nds_renderer_assets.o`, an object no rule builds), the blob
  header's segment-0 flag validated Dream Land's certificate against every
  stage, `layer_mask`/fog/emblem byte lanes were unswapped, and mixed-alpha
  runs could not be submitted. Blob stages have no static texture pin set, so
  PrepareRun step 2 declined forever; the first owner prepare after a blob
  load now uploads once through the live path and guards those entries from
  eviction (`stage_warm`). Two shared texture-state fixes: the render tile
  samples the last LOADBLOCK/LOADTILE at its TMEM address, not the last
  SETTIMG (Zebes palette swaps), and G_SETENVCOLOR is texel state for I/IA
  bakes (Yoshi's Island bushes). Wrapping tiles key without their origin
  (Zebes acid re-upload churn 73 to 24 slots). All eight admit at 29.9 FPS
  entry frames; probe `builds/resume-20260905/stage-qa/stage-admission-all.ps1`,
  shots `artifacts/visibility/2026-09-06_stage-admission-*-shot1.png`.
- **Player tags (2026-09-07, uncommitted):** the five IA8 tag glyphs bake once
  into 4bpp OBJ cells and each frame places one OAM entry from the source's
  own TopN projection (`src/nds/nds_ifcommon_oam.c`,
  `ifCommonPlayerTagMakeInterface` wrapper); the generic compositor is the
  fallback only. The source draws a tag only while `playertag_wait == 1` or
  the camera eye is farther than 6000 units (`if/ifcommon.c:1833`), so tags
  absent in close play is source behaviour. Counters
  `gNdsIFCommonNativeOamFrameRecognizedCalls` / `FrameFallbackCalls`.
- **Congo platforms (2026-09-06):** the layer-1 AObjEvent32 script plans 509
  commands and `NDS_AOBJ_EVENT32_PLAN_MAX` was 128, so the normalizer rejected
  it and the yakumono DObjs never animated. Capacity 640 with a plan
  high-water witness; `gMPCollisionSpeeds[1]` is nonzero. Barrel path open.
- **Zebes entry data abort (2026-09-07, committed):** Mario's event32 Appear
  bound after the 56-frame entry pan while TopN still carried the R2 track
  engine's Q-form TraI AObjs (no interpolate descriptor); the generic walker
  evaluated them through `syInterpCubic(NULL)`. The figatree attach retires
  TopN's and every unscripted joint's AObjs at the event32 hand-over, and
  `ndsTraIDescUsable` guards both interpolation sites with a witness (0 hits
  over 90 presents and a 40 s free run). Earlier `fixupfail=2` readings on
  Zebes/Sector were gdb attached to a stale melonDS left by an aborted probe;
  a fresh emulator reads `openfail=0 fixupfail=0` on both.
- **Zebes crash = event32 ledger exhaustion (2026-09-07):** the probe's crash
  hook caught it: an abort-mode exception (cpsr 0xb7) whose saved return is
  `gcParseDObjAnimJoint` objanim.c:366 (`event32->command.opcode` through a
  garbage joint pointer), then calico's `__excpt_entry` jumped to 0xc68 and
  melonDS raised SIGILL — the visible symptom, not the fault. Ledger census
  (`admission-zebes-l1`): 699 normalized entries carried from the shell at
  battle entry, 3,071 of 3,072 thirty presents in, 27 reason-12 refusals then
  and 46 at present 60 (owners 1 = MObj, 0 = DObj). Zebes' layer-1 material
  animation is eleven 484-word palette scripts (`105_StageZebesFile2.c`),
  ~2,400 entries on their own. A refused attach leaves the GObj without its
  source animation; the refusal that crashed was Mario's entry pipe effect
  (`efManagerMakeEffect(dEFManagerMarioEntryDokanEffectDesc)` eleven presents
  before the fault). `NDS_AOBJ_EVENT32_NORMALIZED_MAX` 3,072 -> 4,096 and its
  index 4,096 -> 8,192 slots (+16,384 B .bss); read
  `gNdsAObjEvent32NormalizedHighWater` over a full Zebes match to right-size.
  The probe gained `-AcidPoke`, a ledger census line at battle entry and per
  shot, `bt 4` on `gcAddAnimAll`, and the `hook-stop` crash printer.
- **Zebes acid picture (2026-09-07):** at level -3000 (status Wait, child y
  +179.8 then -281.2) the drawn surface still covers the lower cliff faces
  (`zebes-c1` shots 1-2), i.e. the acid overdraws stage geometry that should
  occlude it; the stage's no-Z runs carry one constant depth per run
  (`ndsRendererNativeStageSetNoZColumn`), the acid draws with real depth
  through `ndsRendererAdapterSubmitStageDL` (world via the persistent stage
  cache, whose key includes translate). `-AcidPoke` (root -6000) moved the
  picture down, so the height was right and the depth was wrong: the acid
  DL (`MiscDataBank157` +0x9d8, decoded from the staged bytes) renders
  `AA_ZB_XLU_SURF` with Z_CMP and never clears G_ZBUFFER, but
  `ndsStageGCDrawAllLoopInitialGeometryMode` stripped G_ZBUFFER from every
  generic draw not on display link 6 and the acid draws on link 12, so the
  renderer classified it no-Z and painted it in the FOREGROUND band (the
  band after the stage's first source-Z triangle), over the cliffs. Fixed
  2026-09-07: ground actors keep G_ZBUFFER (`sNdsStageGCDrawAllLoopActor-
  KeepsZBuffer`); `zebes-z1` shots 1-3 show the cliff occluding the pool.
  Left to check: the "sphere-like" look while rising (8-vertex plane under
  affine texturing; tessellation is the candidate).
- **Congo barrel picture (2026-09-07):** the native arm draws 2 triangles a
  frame at the live root translate (`local0` row 3 = the DObj's -2748,-1597;
  `jungle-m1`), and moving the child joint +3000 (`-HideBarrel`, `jungle-hb7`)
  moved that arm's matrix but NOT the barrel the owner sees on the left
  platform. `-BarrelNoDv` (child dv = NULL, `jungle-nodv3`): the native arm
  then draws nothing (fail step 1) and the platform barrel is still there,
  so it is not the cannon GObj; moving the child to (+1000, +1900), which
  puts the native quad beside the platform, showed no second barrel either
  (`jungle-hb91`), so the two triangles the native arm submits every frame
  never reach the screen. The jungle packet's binding offsets do not include
  the barrel DL 0xa08. Open: what draws the platform barrel (layer-0 DObjs
  at x -1681 / +1678, `DL_0x84B8` / `DL_0x8548`, are the candidates) and why
  the native quad is invisible (poly alpha, texture bind, v16 range).
- **melonDS host crash under the probe (2026-09-07):** Application log 1000
  `melonDS.exe` exception 0xc000001d at +0x249963 (13:59, 14:02, and every
  `jungle-*` probe after `hb3`), the gdb side reads "Remote communication
  error / Target disconnected" at the VS-mode menu. Zebes runs interleaved
  passed. `Stop-Process -Name melonDS` never matched the owner's `melonDS_4`;
  use `Get-Process melonDS*`. Cause open; rerun on failure.
- **Mushroom Kingdom music (2026-09-07):** seq 2 never clips at gain 0.22 and
  an anti-alias low-pass moves its IMA SNR only +0.8 dB; the track's intrinsic
  IMA SNR is 18.6 dB against 25-29 dB for clean tracks (encoder tracking on
  a dense mix); a beam-search encoder gains +0.2 dB. BGM already plays through
  the SPU hardware IMA channel with zero ARM9 decode. A PCM16 stream for this
  one track costs +2,937,640 B ROM and, at the current packet geometry,
  +49,144 B RAM (`builds/resume-20260905/agents-0906/bgm_hw_adpcm.final.md`);
  owner decision needed because RAM is the binding constraint.
- **Sector Z Arwing file:** FoxSpecial3 (0xa1) reaches a Fox-less match through
  the map's extern chain (0x106 -> 0x99 -> 0xa1; the port's
  `MiscDataBank153` header lists 0xa1 and `ndsRelocAssetIDForToken` maps it
  unconditionally), so the load is source-faithful.
- **Stage actors swallowed by the classifier (2026-09-07):** `gGRCommonStruct`
  is a union; Dream Land's `pupupu.map_gobj[4]` (bytes 4..19) aliases
  Zebes/Sector `map_gobj`, Jungle `tarucann_gobj` and Saffron `gate_gobj`.
  `ndsStageGCDrawAllLoopClassifyGObj` compared those slots on every stage, so
  the barrel, acid, Arwing and gate classified as Dream Land map pieces and
  went down the layer scan (generic stage DL submit) instead of the native
  barrel arm / ground-actor arm (witness `ground_actor calls=0`, `gatebt2
  rec=30`). The comparison is now gated on `gkind == nGRKindPupupu`. The
  source's own draw loop skips hidden GObjs, so the Arwing hidden flag needs
  no arm-side check.
- **Saffron City:** gate GObj exists with children (`gate root dv=nil
  child=set`); packet covers layers 0/1/3; elevators ride inside layer 1 with
  no yakumono-pose-aware commit (`docs/p2/stages/saffron-city.md`).
- **Hyrule scale (owner, 2026-09-07):** `4f8d9a30392` made range runs carry
  max(1, largest packed vertex shift) and split runs by alpha; Hyrule's
  descriptor moved from 72 to 75 runs. Suspect the shift class for the
  owner's "existing geometry's scale was messed up"; unmeasured.

- **Barrel / clouds native arms (2026-09-07):** both compared
  `owner_generation` against `gNdsTaskmanHeapGeneration` (a different
  counter) and rejected every frame once the classifier let them through; they
  now use `ndsRelocGetLoadedAssetView`. The barrel packet is one billboard
  quad (2 triangles, kind 40 + RotRpyR); the owner still reports it invisible
  in play, so `gNdsNativeTaruCannRouteNative` (gdb-settable, default 1)
  routes it through the ground-actor stage route for a one-binary A/B
  (`stage-admission-probe.ps1 -BarrelGeneric`).
- **Effect sprites opaque (heal sparkle 0x0E, item spawn swirl 0x69):** the
  particle bank pack admits only `P1_PARTICLE_SEAMS`
  (`scripts/generate_nds_particle_banks.py:735`, Mario/Fox/Dream Land items
  off); unreachable scripts fall to an opaque quad. The 128x64x4 atlas is
  31,872 of 32,768 bytes with five animated textures already excluded, so the
  12 unadmitted textures (about 12 KB) need a larger atlas budget (VRAM) before
  the seam list can grow to P2 scope. Decision pending.

- **Hyrule tornado damage/throw (owner 2026-09-07):** the port's Twister
  descriptor arithmetic is source-exact (`&llGRHyruleMapMapHeader` = 0x14,
  `&llGRHyruleMapTwisterThrowHitDesc` = 0xbc via `NDS_RELOC_LVALUE`;
  `FTThrowHitDesc` is all s32, so the u32 swap is right); the routing goes
  through the obstacle registry, not the capacity-1 hazard one. No divergence
  found by reading; needs a measured hit (damage/angle/kb witness) in play.
- **Yoshi CSS preview freezes after select (owner 2026-09-07):** the resident
  Selected figatree tables are answered by `ndsBattleShipLoadCSSSelectedFigatree`
  for Yoshi/Ness/Purin/Kirby, but `ndsBattleShipIsCSSSelectedFigatreeJoint`
  (the predicate the Event32 admission and the pointer resolver consult for
  ROM-resident joints) accumulated only Mario/Fox/Luigi/Donkey/Captain/Samus/
  Link/Pikachu, so Yoshi's Selected joints were rejected as "not a loaded
  reloc range" (reason 2) and the pose never advanced. The four tables are
  now recognised; the CSS warm also preloads each kind's selected row
  (Win1..Win4 = submotion rows 1..4) so selection pays no first-touch load.
- **DATA menu (2026-09-07):** native `src/nds/nds_menu_shell_data.c` (three
  font rows on the Option kit; DATA sprites not yet baked, TODO in the file),
  registry row under the shell, harness native case; its children
  (Characters, VS Record, Sound Test) stay campaign-gated source scenes, so
  A on a row is denied fail-closed until their natives land (agent contracts in
  `agents-0906/{soundtest,vsrecord,characters_screen}_contract.final.md`).
- **Sector Arwing paths:** flight scripts live in map extern 0x99 (file 153)
  as AObjEvent32 + SYInterp blocks; the SYInterp header lane fix exists only
  for fighter AObj16 TraI (`ndsRelocSYInterpDescHeaderNative`). Build agent
  `sector_syinterp_lanes` (worktree `_wt_sector`) extends it to event32.
- **Saffron door alpha:** file 160's gate DObjDesc pointers are unrelocated
  intern-chain words, so the DL bytes need a chain walk before the alpha
  contract can be read; parked behind the actor packet pipeline.

- **Entry-pan frame rate (measured 2026-09-07):** Hyrule reads 19.8 FPS and
  Zebes 22.9 FPS while the entry camera pans the whole stage (presents
  60-90), then 29.9 FPS at GO! (present 200). A one-binary A/B of the XObj
  order, the all-stage stretch, the filesystem lock and the range-run shift
  moved nothing, and hiding the Zebes acid moved nothing, so the pan cost is
  the stages' own range-run geometry in view, not a regression from today's
  fixes. The P2 gate is per presented frame at the screen's cadence, so the
  pan still needs its own measurement (tick-HUD stage bucket) before P2-4
  closes.

## Loading

- **Entry animation open failures (2026-09-07, open):** `fopen` of an existing
  nitrofs path (Mario Appear 0x279, Fox Arwing 0x30a) returned ENOENT after the
  direct nitrorom read failed, on Jungle/Hyrule/Zebes, roughly one run in
  three; the force loader then handed the raw heap back and the entry
  animation did not play. A recursive filesystem mutex (`ndsFsLock`) now
  wraps every reloc, BGM, FGM-pack, hit-spark, preview-pack and backup file
  call. The audit (`agents-0906/fs_reentrancy_audit.final.md`) then showed
  the BGM refill runs on the MAIN thread (the worker only starts channels),
  so the lock is not the fix; nine probe runs since read `openfail=0` but the
  miss is not explained. Witnesses left in place: `gNdsRelocAssetDirectFailStep`
  (which direct step failed), `gNdsRelocAssetOpenFailErrno/Asset`, and a
  4x fopen retry with `gNdsRelocAssetOpenRetryCount/SuccessCount`; the next
  recurrence says whether the miss is transient (retry succeeds) or a poisoned
  directory cache. Uncovered file sites the audit lists (FGM pack reads,
  fenced texture fopen, fighter anim stream) matter only if a second thread
  ever reads.

## HUD

- **Blue A / green B during gameplay:** the pause decals
  (`dIFCommonBattlePauseDecalsSpriteData` ids 1-2) are made on pause and
  ejected on unpause through `lbCommonEjectGObjLinkedList`, which was an empty
  weak stub until `08ce35de928` (2026-09-06 23:22). The root `smash64ds.nds`
  the owner played was built 2026-09-06 21:46, before the fix; rebuild and
  confirm with a pause/unpause probe.
