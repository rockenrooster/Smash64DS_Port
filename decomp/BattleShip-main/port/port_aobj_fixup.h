/**
 * port_aobj_fixup.h — per-stream un-halfswap for AObjEvent32 animation data.
 *
 * Fighter reloc files (`reloc_animations/FT*`, `reloc_submotions/FT*`) go
 * through portRelocFixupFighterFigatree at load time, which u16-halfswaps
 * every non-reloc u32 slot.  That is correct for AObjEvent16 figatree
 * data (u16 pairs packed into u32 slots) but corrupts AObjEvent32 u32
 * bitfield commands — opcode lands in bits 9-15 instead of 25-31 and
 * flags splits across the halfswap boundary in a way no bitfield can
 * express.
 *
 * The file contains both stream types, and at load time we can't tell
 * which token targets which kind of stream (the choice is runtime, via
 * fp->anim_desc.flags.is_anim_joint per motion).  So the fix is lazy:
 * the first time an EVENT32 reader touches a stream, we walk it from the
 * head, un-halfswap each data u32 in place, skip token slots, and record
 * the head in a visited set so subsequent passes are no-ops.
 *
 * Callers: gcParseDObjAnimJoint and gcParseMObjMatAnimJoint in
 * src/sys/objanim.c (at function entry, wrapped in #ifdef PORT).
 *
 * The head is passed as void* so the header has no game-type dependency.

 * Walk an AObjEvent32 stream starting at @p head, un-halfswapping every
 * data u32 encountered (command words, flag words, f32 payloads) until
 * the End opcode (0) or a stream-terminating Jump/SetAnim.  Token slots
 * inside Jump/SetAnim/SetInterp events are left alone (the reloc chain
 * already wrote native u32 token indices into those).  Jump and SetAnim
 * targets are walked recursively.  Idempotent via an internal visited
