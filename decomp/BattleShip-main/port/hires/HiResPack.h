/* Hi-res texture pack registry.
 *
 * Scans <app-data>/mods/ recursively at startup for PNG files whose names
 * follow the grammar:
 *
 *   <anything>#<rgba8CRC32>#<fmt>#<siz>[_<anything>].png
 *
 * The hash key is a CRC32-IEEE over the *decoded* RGBA8 image — the same
 * tightly-packed pixel buffer the GPU receives at upload time. This makes
 * the key independent of N64 source byte layout (Sprite/Bitmap/raw/CI all
 * decode to the same RGBA8 and hash the same), so the runtime hook can
 * sit downstream of every format-specific decoder and the offline pack-
 * conversion tool can derive the same key by decoding each pack PNG.
 *
 * Each parsed entry is stored in an in-memory map keyed by
 * (rgba8CRC, fmt, siz). PNG decoding is deferred to first lookup; Init()
 * only builds the index.
 *
 * Pack folders work additively — drop multiple subfolders under mods/ and
 * the union of their PNGs is indexed. If two PNGs hash-collide the later
 * scan wins (alphabetical order).
