# Netplay Architecture

## Purpose

`src/sys/netinput.c` and `src/sys/netinput.h` prepare the VS Mode controller path for rollback netcode. The module owns deterministic per-player input samples for each VS simulation tick, records those samples in bounded history buffers, and republishes the resolved input through the existing `SYController` globals that battle code already consumes.

Companion handoff notes for future agent sessions live in `docs/netcode_agent_rules.md`.

This keeps the first netplay boundary at the controller layer:

- local hardware input still comes from `src/sys/controller.c`
- battle simulation still reads `gSYControllerDevices`
- netplay-only input policy lives in `src/sys/netinput.c`
- debug replay file I/O lives in `src/sys/netreplay.c`
- debug UDP P2P transport and match bootstrap live in `src/sys/netpeer.c`
- narrow gameplay-state hashing for diagnostics lives in `src/sys/netsync.c`

## Current Integration

VS battle uses `syNetInputFuncRead` as its controller callback. 1P Game, Training Mode, Bonus 1 Practice, Bonus 2 Practice, menus, and other non-VS scenes remain on `syControllerFuncRead`.

The VS update order is:

```text
VS scene start
  -> syNetInputStartVSSession()
  -> syNetReplayStartVSSession()
  -> syNetPeerStartVSSession()
  -> bootstrap P2P sessions enable the execution gate
  -> netinput tick starts at 0

taskman game tick during VS
  -> scene controller callback
  -> syNetInputFuncRead()
  -> syControllerFuncRead()
  -> resolve one SYNetInputFrame per player for the current tick
  -> publish resolved frames into gSYControllerDevices
  -> advance netinput tick once the optional P2P start barrier is released
  -> scene_update()
  -> syNetPeerUpdateBattleGate()
  -> return early if bootstrap P2P execution is not ready
  -> syNetReplayUpdate()
  -> syNetPeerUpdate()
  -> fighter input derivation
```

`syNetInputGetTick()` returns a VS-local tick counter reset by `syNetInputStartVSSession()`. `dSYTaskmanUpdateCount` remains part of the engine, but netplay input history is keyed by match-local time so rematches and scene transitions do not reuse stale global tick assumptions.

The P2P start barrier and VS execution gate are debug-only and only active when both `SSB64_NETPLAY=1` and `SSB64_NETPLAY_BOOTSTRAP=1` are set. Local VS, replay playback/recording, and manual P2P input injection without bootstrap continue advancing netinput and VS updates immediately.

## Canonical Input Frame

`SYNetInputFrame` is the deterministic input record used by netplay:

```c
typedef struct SYNetInputFrame
{
    u32 tick;
    u16 buttons;
    s8 stick_x;
    s8 stick_y;
    u8 source;
    ub8 is_predicted;
    ub8 is_valid;

} SYNetInputFrame;
```

The canonical frame stores held buttons and analog stick position only. `SYController.button_tap`, `button_release`, and `button_update` are derived when publishing back into the legacy controller globals.

## Input Sources

Each controller slot has a `SYNetInputSource`:

| Source | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `nSYNetInputSourceLocal` | Read the current local `gSYControllerDevices[player]` state after `syControllerFuncRead()` updates it. |
| `nSYNetInputSourceRemoteConfirmed` | Use a remote input sample already delivered for this tick. |
| `nSYNetInputSourceRemotePredicted` | Use confirmed remote input if present; otherwise predict from the last confirmed remote input, or neutral if none exists. |
| `nSYNetInputSourceSaved` | Use a saved input sample for replay or deterministic validation. |

Slots default to local input. This means routing VS battle through `syNetInputFuncRead()` should preserve local controller behavior until a caller explicitly changes a VS slot source.

## History Buffers

`netinput.c` keeps three bounded ring buffers per player:

- `sSYNetInputHistory` — resolved and published inputs used by simulation
- `sSYNetInputRemoteHistory` — confirmed remote inputs staged by tick
- `sSYNetInputSavedHistory` — saved/replay inputs staged by tick

All buffers use `SYNETINPUT_HISTORY_LENGTH` and index by `tick % SYNETINPUT_HISTORY_LENGTH`. Reads validate both `is_valid` and exact `tick` to reject stale ring entries.

For full-match debug replay files, `netinput.c` also keeps a separate replay frame stream capped by `SYNETINPUT_REPLAY_MAX_FRAMES`. This avoids treating the 720-frame rollback ring as permanent replay storage.

## Publishing To SYController

`syNetInputPublishFrame()` converts a canonical frame back into the existing `SYController` shape:

- `button_hold` comes from `SYNetInputFrame.buttons`
- `stick_range.x/y` come from `stick_x/stick_y`
- `button_tap` is computed from the previous published canonical buttons
- `button_release` is computed from the previous published canonical buttons
- `button_update` currently mirrors newly pressed buttons

`syNetInputPublishMainController()` mirrors player 0 into `gSYControllerMain` for systems that read the main controller global.

## VS Replay Direction

Saved VS replays are deterministic engine re-runs, not video captures. The current debug replay file includes:

- magic and version
- metadata size, frame size, frame count, player count, and input checksum
- VS scene/mode identifier
- initial battle settings and player slot setup
- stage, stocks/time/rules, item settings, characters, costumes, teams, handicaps, CPU levels, and match-start RNG seed
- per-player `SYNetInputFrame` stream
- source-independent input checksum for record/playback comparison

Playback resets the VS netinput session, loads metadata, stages full-match replay inputs, sets replayed slots to `nSYNetInputSourceSaved`, restores the match-start RNG seed, and runs the normal game engine.

The debug runner is controlled with environment variables:

```sh
cd build
SSB64_REPLAY_RECORD=/tmp/test.ssb64r SSB64_REPLAY_RECORD_FRAMES=1800 ./BattleShip
SSB64_REPLAY_PLAY=/tmp/test.ssb64r ./BattleShip
```

`SSB64_REPLAY_RECORD_FRAMES` is optional and defaults to 1800 frames. Record mode still uses the normal VS menus; playback mode loads the file and jumps directly into VS battle using the saved metadata.

## Debug P2P Netplay

`src/sys/netpeer.c` adds a UDP-only debug transport for manual P2P testing. It is not a final lobby or NAT traversal layer; it exists to prove that two local game instances can share match setup and exchange per-tick input frames.

Current debug environment variables:

- `SSB64_NETPLAY=1` enables the UDP P2P module.
- `SSB64_NETPLAY_LOCAL_PLAYER` selects the local slot index.
- `SSB64_NETPLAY_REMOTE_PLAYER` selects the remote slot index.
- `SSB64_NETPLAY_BIND` is the local IPv4 bind address in `host:port` form.
- `SSB64_NETPLAY_PEER` is the remote IPv4 address in `host:port` form.
- `SSB64_NETPLAY_DELAY` offsets sent input ticks by a fixed frame delay. It defaults to 2.
- `SSB64_NETPLAY_SESSION` optionally overrides the packet session id. It defaults to 1.
- `SSB64_NETPLAY_BOOTSTRAP=1` enables automatic VS match bootstrap.
- `SSB64_NETPLAY_HOST=1` marks the peer that creates and sends match metadata.
- `SSB64_NETPLAY_SEED` optionally overrides the bootstrap match RNG seed.

Packet phases:

- `INPUT` packets carry recent local `SYNetInputFrame` samples, tagged with delayed VS-local ticks and staged into the remote confirmed input history.
- `MATCH_CONFIG` packets carry explicit `SYNetInputReplayMetadata` so both peers enter the same VS battle with the same stage, rules, players, characters, and RNG seed.
- Bootstrap `READY` / `START` packets complete the pre-VS metadata handshake.
- In-battle `BATTLE_READY` / `BATTLE_START` packets align the VS-local netinput tick before runtime input packets begin.

Match metadata sync, input tick start sync, and VS execution sync are separate layers:

- Metadata bootstrap makes both peers enter the same battle state.
- The input tick barrier keeps `syNetInputGetTick()` at 0 until both peers have reached VS and exchanged readiness.
- The VS execution gate keeps `scVSBattleFuncUpdate()` from advancing battle/interface presentation while the bootstrap barrier is still waiting.

The execution gate is intentionally shaped as a reusable readiness query. Future runtime pacing, peer advertised ticks, and rollback readiness checks should build on this boundary instead of adding more one-off checks to the VS scene.

Bootstrap P2P input packets (`INPUT`, wire version `SYNETPEER_VERSION` 2):

- Carry a strictly increasing UDP send `packet_seq`, included in the packet checksum and surfaced as cumulative `gap` / `dup` / `ooo` counters when sequence jumps repeat, advance with holes, or arrive behind the observed high watermark.
- Bundle the last 16 simulated local frames (`SYNETPEER_MAX_PACKET_FRAMES`), each with delayed tick + buttons/stick, serialized explicitly (not raw struct casts).
- Still embed `ack_tick`: the sender’s tracked `sSYNetPeerHighestRemoteTick` advertised to the peer (see `peer_ack=` / `puck=` lines in logs).

Operational desync instrumentation (logged only when UDP netplay is active and bootstrap execution is released):

| Log prefix | Approx. cadence | Use |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --- |
| `SSB64 NetPeer:` | Every 120 sim ticks (`SYNETPEER_LOG_INTERVAL`) | Transport counters, sequence diagnostics, staged frames, cumulative remote-input fingerprint (`inpchk`). |
| `SSB64 NetSync:` | Same ticks as NetPeer summaries | **`hist_win=[begin,end)`** — half-open `[begin,end)` VS tick range hashed from **resolved published history only** (`sSYNetInputHistory`) using the same logical fields as replay validation (player id + tick + buttons + sticks). **`all`** / **`p0..p3`** show combined and per-slot checksums. **`figh`** is `syNetSyncHashBattleFighters()` over active fighter `FTStruct` scalars plus selected velocities and `coll_data.pos_prev` using IEEE754 bit reinterpretation — order-independent across controller ports. **`pko`/`pkn`** are oldest/newest frame ticks bundled in the most recent validated remote `INPUT` packet (or sentinel `4294967295` when **`pkt_valid=0`**). **`gap`/`dup`/`ooo`** track inferred sequence anomalies. |

Debug workflow:

1. After metadata bootstrap and execution gate, confirm **`SSB64 NetSync`** lines appear on matching ticks across host/client logs.
2. If **`hist_win`** checksum columns diverge first, prioritize packet redundancy, deserialization, staging order, tick assignment, or prediction quirks before rewriting rollback.
3. If input windows match while **`figh`** diverges, widen or narrow deterministic gameplay hashes before blaming UDP pacing.
4. If both stay aligned but observers still perceive drift, escalate to pacing / telemetry using the same instrumentation hooks.

`cmake` discovers `src/sys/*.c` through `file(GLOB_RECURSE …)`; adding a netplay sys source requires re-running CMake configuration (for example `cmake -B build`) so the glob refreshes before the next build.

## Validation Path

Before adding sockets or rollback state restoration, use the saved-input path to validate deterministic VS input replay:

1. Run a local battle with all slots set to local input.
2. Capture `sSYNetInputHistory` through `syNetInputGetHistoryFrame()`.
3. Re-stage those samples with `syNetInputSetSavedInput()`.
4. Set the relevant slots to `nSYNetInputSourceSaved`.
5. Compare `syNetInputGetHistoryInputChecksum()` against the replay file checksum.

This verifies the input layer can reproduce the same per-tick controller stream before introducing rollback state rewind.

## Non-Goals

This module does not yet implement:

- matchmaking, lobby, ELO, region, or ping selection
- STUN/TURN, NAT traversal, or relay fallback
- game-state snapshot/restore
- framebuffer rollback
- exhaustive determinism hashing of fighter/world state (only narrow diagnostic hashes ship today via `netsync.c`)
- wall-clock input scheduling, rollback prediction windows, or resimulation
- netplay support for 1P Game, Training Mode, Bonus 1 Practice, or Bonus 2 Practice

Those systems should build on top of this input boundary rather than bypassing it.
